|----Redhat linux上安装gcc编译器
     http://www.360doc.com/content/05/1024/22/126_23492.shtml
     库文件路径还没有设置
     tar xzvf gcc-?.?.?.tar.gz $srcdir
     另新建一个文件夹
     在里面执行$srcdir/configure --prefix=
     这样的话，打包出来的文件没有动，安装又安装到了一个新的地方，类似于windows下面的绿色程序

     hard link

     file system: inode
     user: name
     我们看到只是name
     我们去操作一个文件名的时候实际上是去操作实际的文件

     hard link: just one inode have more names
     symbolic link: 
     符号链接实际上是一种特殊的文件类型
     这种文件包含了另一个文件的任意一个路径名

|----Ingo malnar, from wiki.
    Ingo Molnár, currently employed by Red Hat, is a Hungarian Linux hacker.
    He is best-known for his contributions to the operating system in terms of
    security and performance. Some of his additions to the Linux include an O(1)
    and CFS scheduler in the 2.6.x kernel series, the in-kernel TUX HTTP / FTP
    server, as well as his work to enhance thread handling.[1] He also wrote a
    kernel security feature called "Exec Shield", which prevents stack-based
    buffer overflow exploits in the x86 architecture by disabling the execute
    permission for the stack. One of his recent projects is the realtime
    preemption patch, which aims to bring hard-realtime scheduling latencies
    (50–60 microseconds worst-case execution time) to Linux.
    Most recently, he has been working on the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS), an
    O(log n) scheduler that is included as of the 2.6.23 Linux.[2]
